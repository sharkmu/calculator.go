# Calculator in Go
This is / going to be a very basic calculator app written in Go.
The sole purpose of it for me is to practice and learn **golang**

## Installation
1. Make sure you have Go installed: https://golang.org/dl/
2. Clone this repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/sharkmu/calculator.go.git
    ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd calculator.go
    ```
4. Build the application:
    ```
    go build
    ```
